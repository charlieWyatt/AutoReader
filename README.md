# AutoReader


## What is it

This project consists of two files: "ground_truth.txt" and "PageReader.ipynb".

The "ground_truth.txt" file contains any image with text

The "PageReader.ipynb" file is a Python script that demonstrates various image processing and text recognition operations. It utilizes the OpenCV library for image processing and the Tesseract OCR engine for text recognition. The script includes functions for image preprocessing, such as grayscale conversion, noise removal, thresholding, and more. It also demonstrates how to display intermediate images resulting from each operation. Additionally, the script utilizes the pytesseract library to put bounding boxes around characters and words in an input image and compares the extracted text with a ground truth text file using the Levenshtein distance metric. The script outputs the original image text, thresholded image text, opening image text, and canny image text, along with the similarity scores to the ground truth text. The file then does a rudeimentary text to speech as a placeholder for future

## Requirements

To run the "PageReader.ipynb" script, the following dependencies are required:
- Python
- OpenCV library
- Tesseract OCR engine
- pytesseract library

Additionally, the script expects the following files to be present:
- "image.jpg"
- "IMG_6974.jpg"
- "ground_truth.txt"

Ensure that these files are in the same directory as the script.

## How to run it

To run the script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the required dependencies and files are in place.
2. Open a command-line interface and navigate to the directory containing the script and necessary files.
3. Run the command `python testingImageToText.py`.
4. The script will execute the various image processing and text recognition operations on the input image "IMG_6974.jpg" and compare the extracted text to the ground truth text in "ground_truth.txt".
5. The output, including the extracted text and similarity scores, will be displayed in the command-line interface.

## Examples

Here are some examples to illustrate the usage of the script:

Example 1:
```
python testingImageToText.py
```
Output:
```
Original Image Text: "Lorem Ipsum"

Thresholded Image Text: "L0r3m 1psuM"

Opening Image Text: "Lorem Ipsvm"

Canny Image Text: "L o r e m I p s u m"

Levenshtein Distance: 2
Similarity Score: 0.84
```

Example 2:
```
python testingImageToText.py
```
Output:
```
Original Image Text: "Hello World!"

Thresholded Image Text: "Hello World!"

Opening Image Text: "Hello World!"

Canny Image Text: "Hello World!"

Levenshtein Distance: 0
Similarity Score: 1.0
```

These examples showcase the output of the script, including the extracted text from different image processing operations and the similarity score to the ground truth text.

Overall, this project provides a self-contained excerpt in "ground_truth.txt" and a Python script "PageReader.ipynb" that showcases various image processing and text recognition tasks. With the required dependencies and input files, users can run the script to extract text from an input image and compare it to the ground truth text.
